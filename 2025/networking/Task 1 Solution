# 🌐 Week 1: Networking Challenge - Task 1
## Mastering the OSI & TCP/IP Models

Welcome to the first task of my **#90DaysOfDevOps** journey! Today, I focused on the fundamental "plumbing" of the internet: understanding how data travels across a network using the OSI and TCP/IP models.

---

## 📖 Overview
In DevOps, networking knowledge is critical for troubleshooting connectivity issues, configuring cloud security groups, and managing microservices. 

### The Two Models:
1. **OSI Model (Theoretical):** A 7-layer framework used to standardize the functions of a computing system.
2. **TCP/IP Model (Practical):** A 4-layer model that represents the actual protocols used on the internet today.

## 🛠️ Mapping Layers to Real-World Scenarios

| OSI Layer | TCP/IP Layer | Purpose | Real-World Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **7. Application** | **Application** | User Interface & Services | Accessing a website via **HTTP/HTTPS** |
| **6. Presentation** | **Application** | Data Encryption & Formatting | **SSL/TLS** encrypting your login credentials |
| **5. Session** | **Application** | Connection Management | Maintaining your login session on a portal |
| **4. Transport** | **Transport** | End-to-end communication | **TCP** ensuring data arrives without errors |
| **3. Network** | **Internet** | Routing & IP Addressing | **IP Addresses** routing packets across VPCs |
| **2. Data Link** | **Network Access** | MAC Addressing | **Ethernet** frames moving within a local LAN |
| **1. Physical** | **Network Access** | Physical Hardware | **Fiber optic cables** or Wi-Fi signals |

## 💡 Why This Matters for DevOps
Understanding these layers allows me to troubleshoot systematically:
* **Application Issue?** Check the HTTP status codes (4xx/5xx).
* **Routing Issue?** Check the IP tables or Route Tables (Layer 3).

## 🚀 Next Steps
Now that the foundation is set, I will move on to **Task 2: Protocols and Ports for DevOps**, where I'll dive deeper into specific communication standards like SSH, DNS, and FTP.
